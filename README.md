"Crafting Earth's Defense: Our mission to assemble the ultimate cricket team for the intergalactic battle against aliens. Leveraging web scraping techniques using Bright Data, we collected crucial player statistics in JSON and CSV formats. Jupiter Notebook and pandas library played a pivotal role in cleaning and preprocessing data from files like wc_wickets, wc_ballers, and wc_batsman. Employing DAX functions and data modeling, we built a comprehensive Power BI dashboard, guiding us in the selection of the best 11 players for Earth's survival. Special thanks to codebasics for providing deep insights and expertise in tackling such extraterrestrial challenges. 🏏👽🌍 #EarthVsAliens #CricketWar #DataDrivenDefense"
